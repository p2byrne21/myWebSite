            <h2>Paragraph 2</h2>
        
            <p>The reason why I chose Steph Curry as my hero is because throughout his career, Curry has displayed great leadership. He is not afarid to speak out about what he believes in and he knows that he can use his sports platform to speak his truth. I believe that he is making a difference and that is something that I want to do in my sports career as well.</p>
